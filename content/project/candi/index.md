The objective of the CANDI project is to develop the foundations of cellular ad hoc networking as a support for next-generation distributed applications that require direct communication between devices in proximity of each other over multiple hops.
Examples of such applications are public safety (i.e., disaster scenarios when the cellular infrastructure is unavailable), railway virtual coupling (i.e., platoons of trains), smart factories and farming, and others.
To achieve this, the CANDI project will leverage wireless ad hoc networking concepts with recent 5G cellular innovations proposing multi-hop device-to-device communications.
It will investigate cooperative resource allocation mechanisms, as well as joint relaying & scheduling approaches to enable multi-hop communication for next-generation decentralized cellular networks.
