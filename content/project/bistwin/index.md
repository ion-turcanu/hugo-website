The objective of the BISTWIN project is to build a mobility digital twin (MDT) of the “Um Rouscht” industrial zone in Bissen to serve as basis for RDI activities, including planning, development, and validation of mobility solutions by various stakeholders while targeting economic transformation.
This system will be based on a high-performance digital twin solution for city scale transport systems, which will reproduce the mobility in this area in a highly detailed way, considering the existing modes of transport, and targeting the improvement of various key performance indicators (KPIs) targeted by the mobility managers and other stakeholders present in the area.
