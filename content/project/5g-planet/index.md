5G-PLANET will build on LIST’s expertise to propose a decision support system to plan and design 5G networks for cooperative, connected and automated (CCAM) mobility applications. This system will be the subject of demonstrations to raise public awareness about the interest of these technologies. To do so, LIST will rely on a Digital Twin approach, by creating a digital replica of Luxembourg’s 5G infrastructure. The objective is first and foremost to offer a visual and attractive showcase to raise the public awareness about:

1. <u>System architecture</u>: how 5G networks can be used and deployed for connected mobility applications, with a focus on vehicular communications.
 
2. <u>Connected mobility sector</u>: what is the impact of 5G on mobility performance compared to other communication technologies: is it better and how much? We will include as many use-cases as we can (depending on data availability and stakeholder support).
 
3. <u>Decision support for Luxembourg</u>: what would be the interest of developing a 5G network digital twin for Luxembourg?

The project will be broken down into two phases. The first phase will target the Connecting Tomorrow: 5G, Broadband and Beyond conference in October 2021, where three activities will be covered by LIST (i.e., live presentation, workshop, presence as exhibitor). The second phase will be after the conference and will include further dissemination activities. 5G-PLANET will rely on a combination of simulation and emulation components to operate. In addition to the pure software part, the project will also build an open 5G antenna, developed in Laboratory mode, so as to allow anyone equipped with a 5G phone to experiment the real capabilities of a 5G network, and interact with LIST’ software solutions.
