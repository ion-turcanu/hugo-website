5G-MOBIX aims at executing CCAM trials along x-border and urban corridors using 5G core technological innovations to qualify the 5G infrastructure and evaluate its benefits in the CCAM context as well as defining deployment scenarios and identifying and responding to standardization and spectrum gaps. 
5G-MOBIX will first define the critical scenarios needing advanced connectivity provided by 5G, and the required features to enable those advanced CCAM use cases.
The matching between the advanced CCAM use cases and the expected benefit of 5G will be tested during trials on 5G corridors in different EU countries as well as China and Korea.

Those trials will allow running evaluation and impact assessments and defining also business impacts and cost/benefit analysis.
As a result of these evaluations and also internation consultations with the public and industry stakeholders, 5GMOBIX will propose views for new business opportunity for the 5G enabled CCAM and recommendations and options for the deployment.
Also the 5G-MOBIX finding in term of technical requirements and operational conditions will allow to actively contribute to the standardization and spectrum allocation activities.
5G-MOBIX will evaluate several CCAM use cases, advanced thanks to 5G next generation of Mobile Networks.
Among the possible scenarios to be evaluated with the 5G technologies, 5G-MOBIX has raised the potential benefit of 5G with low reliable latency communication, enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communication and network slicing.
Several automated mobility use cases are potential candidates to benefit and even more be enabled by the advanced features and performance of the 5G technologies, as for instance, but limited to: cooperative overtake, highway lane merging, truck platooning, valet parking, urban environment driving, road user detection, vehicle remote control, see through, HD map update, media & entertainment.
