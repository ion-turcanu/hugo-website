### **Objective (ECTS: 4)**	
The Internet and computer networks are now ubiquitous and a growing number of computing activities strongly depend on the correct operation of the underlying networks. Many computing applications that are used today would not be possible without networks. The objective of the course is to give an introduction to networking at large, and TCP/IP networks specifically. The course will provide an introduction to current network architectures, application level protocols (e.g., http), transport protocols (TCP/UDP), routing and IP. The course will introduce Medium Access Control techniques as well as quantitative performance measures for networks. The course will also give a first introduction to mathematical concepts of networks.

The course will consist of approx. 28 hours of teaching and 28 hours of practical exercises.
