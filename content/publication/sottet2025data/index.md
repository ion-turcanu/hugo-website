abstract: "The concept of Network Digital Twin (NDT) has emerged to deal with the increasing complexity of mobile network management and optimization. NDTs replicate the real network state and behavior to act as a sandbox detecting anomalies, optimizing the overall system performance, and automating processes. Data is the fuel of any DT. It notably helps in monitoring and building a future vision of the system. Beyond the volume of data, there is the question of governance, regulation, and ensuring data exchange between various stakeholders. The concept of Data Space (DS) arises as a potential governance solution for NDT data exchange – already used in several verticals, but poorly in networking. In this poster, we aim to foster discussion around DS and the related challenges and opportunities underlying NDT data exchange, in view of future 6G systems."
