abstract: "The integration of autonomous robots in last-mile delivery systems raises technological challenges such as communication, navigation, and cybersecurity. Blockchain offers a secure and transparent solution, but its scalability is a concern. In this paper, we present a co-simulation framework that combines the SUMO mobility simulator with the Ethereum Proof of Stake (POS) blockchain. We evaluate the impact of increasing the number of autonomous robots on blockchain performance, using Transaction Execution Time (TET) and Transaction Finality Time (TFT) as metrics. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and challenges of using blockchain in autonomous delivery systems."
