abstract: "Previous efforts focusing on 5G support for teleoperated driving mainly targeted communication challenges and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), developing and evaluating key 5G enabling technologies such as network slicing, seamless cross-border roaming, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) enabled distributed computing, or predictive Quality of Service and Experience (QoS, QoE). However, these KPIs are at odds with energy conservation measures, with energy savings being a major KPI of modern mobile broadband networks. This poses significant challenges, calling for new thinking and new system architectures that go beyond the current 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). In this paper, we present the vision of the European 6G-TWIN project for leveraging digital twins to provide a safe and efficient communication infrastructure for teleoperated driving, along with a demonstrator design to validate the project’s solutions."
