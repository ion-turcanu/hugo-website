abstract: "In 5G New Radio (NR)-Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Mode 2 sidelink, vehicles autonomously select resources for periodic broadcasts using either Dynamic Scheduling (DS) or Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS). SPS typically reduces collisions by selecting radio resources based on channel sensing and persisting on the same radio resource, which is shown to improve efficiency of spatial reuse. However, our study shows that this does not always improve the Age of Information (AoI). Persistence induces bursts of message losses, creating extended gaps between successful updates. Consequently, DS – despite potentially achieving lower Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) – often achieves better AoI for realistic performance targets. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between reliability (PDR) and timeliness (AoI) and highlight the need for careful persistence management in vehicular communication systems."
