abstract: "Cooperative Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) require multiple disjunct In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) to interact via wireless networks, making communication across vehicles prone to unnecessary queuing delays. Earlier studies have focused on updating wireless networks to integrate with IVNs, which would require substantial changes to the core and access network. In this work, we motivate an approach that moves complexity to the network edge, examining the potentials of mixing Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) wired networks and unmodified, best-effort wireless networks for Vehicle to Everything (V2X). Guided by a platooning use case, we present results from a simple proof-of-concept system simulation demonstrating the potentials of such an approach as well as the feasibility of performance evaluation in openly available simulation frameworks."
