abstract: "As the telecommunications industry moves towards 6G, Network Digital Twins (NDTs) have emerged as a useful means for real-time monitoring, automation, and performance optimization in next-generation networks. This paper contributes to the ongoing research on NDTs within the framework of the 6G-TWIN project by presenting a comprehensive vision for NDT architecture and establishing baseline definitions for NDT data models, i.e., basic and functional models. We propose a structured taxonomy for the data required by these models to ensure a shared semantics consistent with existing standards. Furthermore, we introduce a graph-based modeling approach that provides a foundation for constructing basic models within NDTs, representing the physical network. Lastly, we discuss the challenges related to constructing basic models and propose future directions to address them."
