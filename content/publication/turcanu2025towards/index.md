abstract: "Urban and industrial areas increasingly face complex mobility challenges due to growing commuter demand, infrastructure constraints, and the need for sustainable transport solutions. However, there remains a lack of advanced digital tools to support long-term planning and scenario-based decision-making in such contexts. This paper addresses this gap by presenting BISTWIN, a Mobility Planning Digital Twin (MPDT) designed to support mobility planning in the Bissen industrial zone, Luxembourg. BISTWIN integrates historical traffic data with a high-performance simulation engine to evaluate the impact of mobility interventions. The key contributions include: (i) developing an MPDT tailored to the Bissen industrial zone, (ii) validating the model with publicly available traffic data, and (iii) demonstrating its decision support capabilities through two “what-if” scenarios. BISTWIN offers a scalable framework for sustainable transportation planning, providing valuable insights for future MPDT applications in industrial and urban settings."
