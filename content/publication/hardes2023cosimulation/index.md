abstract: "Many exciting future research topics in the field of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) require the simulation of both connectivity and automation components. However, existing simulation tools focus on only one of these two aspects while making idealistic assumptions about the other. In this work, we motivate the use of established libraries such as gRPC to couple existing independent simulation tools tailored to either connectivity or automation, and demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach. We also describe an Open Source reference implementation coupling CARLA and Veins."
