abstract: "New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology promises safer and more efficient transportation by enabling direct communication between vehicles. Resource allocation in NR V2X Sidelink (SL) mode 2(a) faces challenges like the hidden node problem, prompting the proposal of cooperative resource scheduling, such as in mode 2(b). However, mode 2(b) definition is still in its infancy and lacks performance evaluation. In this paper, we present a cooperative resource scheduling scheme inspired by mode 2(b) to address these challenges. Through simulation-based evaluation, we demonstrate its potential, especially in virtual train coupling scenarios, offering insights to improve NR V2X communication."
