abstract: "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is essential for facilitating connected and automated driving, where vehicles and other road traffic participants share data instantaneously and cooperate to solve tricky traffic situations in milliseconds. This paper proposes two stochastic models for the V2X standard IEEE 802.11p to characterize amongst other things the Age of Information (AoI), a recently-proposed metric that measures the freshness of information. The first model is based on renewal process analysis of a tagged station with mean field approximation, while the second one adopts Markov chain approach with network level view. Analytical results show that IEEE 802.11p, given its adaptability to event-triggered and aperiodic messaging, supports advanced cooperative driving scenarios."
