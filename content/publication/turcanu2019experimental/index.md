abstract: "The main objectives of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) vision is to improve road safety, traffic management, and mobility by enabling cooperative communication among participants. This vision requires the knowledge of the current state of the road traffic, which can be obtained by collecting Floating Car Data (FCD) information using Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) based on the IEEE 802.11 p standard. Most of the existing FCD collection protocols have been evaluated via simulations and mathematical models, while the real-world implications have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper presents an open-source implementation of two state-of-the-art FCD collection algorithms, namely BASELINE and DISCOVER. These algorithms are implemented in an open-source vehicular prototyping platform and validated in a real-world experimental setup."
